Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the Supernova Surfers PocketQube Project. Our team, comprising passionate space enthusiasts and skilled future engineers, has embarked on a groundbreaking journey to explore and understand the intricacies of our planet's atmosphere and its interactions with the cosmos.

# **Project Overview:**
Project Overview:
The Supernova Surfers team has embarked on an ambitious journey to design and deploy a PocketQube, a miniaturized satellite that conforms to the standard dimensions of 5cm^3. This compact marvel is not just about size; it's a powerhouse packed with cutting-edge sensors and modules.
As it journeys through the atmosphere, it's poised to capture a diverse range of data, from atmospheric pressure to magnetic field variations. The MPU 9250 module, a key component, plays a dual role in serving both our primary and secondary mission objectives. Our primary mission revolves around recording data such as barometric pressure, temperature, and acceleration on three axes. The secondary missions, derived from brainstorming sessions, are equally compelling. 
They include advanced weather forecasting, tropospheric ozone monitoring, and a comprehensive analysis of Earth's magnetic field dynamics. The data collected will be stored on an SD card in ".txt" format, with a sampling rate of 20 Hz.
Post-flight, our team will delve into data analysis, creating graphs and visual representations to extract meaningful insights.
The ultimate goal? To contribute to the scientific community's understanding of atmospheric dynamics and magnetic interactions in space.
